# hangman_project

This is a seperate one man project I worked on beside the required projects we worked on together as a team. Please look for the video that showcases the project.
I started from a basic terminal based hangman game that I further developed into a more advanced version.
There are several difficulties to choose from along with a single or multiplayer option.
The main code files contains a couple of descriptive comments helping you guide through and understand the code.
Along with the python based game I created a flask application that allows a user to be created. This then paired with a MYSQL database allows for record keeping of the played games. 
Since this is a purely backend focussed project there are no html files, hence an API tool needs to be used to create an user.
